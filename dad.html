            <p class="line">
                A father and his adult son step off the rickety red tourist trolley. Its vestigial nose is annoying. The sun's rays penetrate
                their clothing, causing dark ellipses to form where they perspirate. Streetside, the seven foot façade offers
                privacy to Athen's inhabitants and graffitied glimpses of their youthful indignation. The streets are littered
                and uneven, causing the father to trip and curse more than once.
            </p>
            <p class="line">
                A short prematurely graying man calls out from behind the pair as they walk along. He asks if they have the time and the
                son is reminded of one of the few tales his father has relayed to him from his youth in which he was threatened
                with robbery by a man in an Italian city who had asked the same question. Surprised when his father doesn't
                abide by his own anecdotal wisdom, the son watches as his father retrieves his watch from his pocket which
                he had placed their for safe keeping.
            </p>
            <p class="line">
                --Where are you from? You look Armenian, the man says, as if the time made no difference.
            </p>
            <p class="line">
                --Hey, he's pretty good, the father says to his son.
            </p>
            <p class="line">
                --We're from New York, the son offers.
            </p>
            <p class="line">
                --Are you from upstate or the city? the man inquires, surprising them both with his knowledge of the distinction. They tell
                him the former.
            </p>
            <p class="line">
                --I have an Armenian friend in upstate New York. Lots of Armenians up there in Rome.
            </p>
            <p class="line">
                The father is excited by the coincidence.
            </p>
            <p class="line">
                --Yes, come, come, I'll buy you a drink at my bar and give you his phone number.
            </p>
            <p class="line">
                The son recalls the bar scams he had read about while researching travel survival guides. They agree to take drinks the the
                friendly stranger regardless.
            </p>
            <p class="line">
                They follow him for two blocks, the man filling silences with standard questions people ask tourists. They arrive at a corner-facing
                door. A red and black sign above reads LADY BAR. It gives the impression that it would be less off-putting
                at night. The son dreads the possibility of it being a strip joint, while his father is too unobservant to
                notice the name at all. The three of them vacate the afternoon son and enter an artificially darkened room,
                an ambience assisted by the large tinted windows on either side of the entrance.
            </p>
            <p class="line">
                The horseshoe-shaped bar is vacant except for two Eastern European women leaning on pillars that dissect the room into three
                parts. Hustler-model smiles expose their teeth. They're short, with long legs and large chests. THey greet
                the pair as the man who dragged them off the street disappears behind one of the pillars wordlessly. The
                sons tries to hint to his father that they should leave while struggling to maintain an air of politeness.
                It's a futile attempt, as the woman on the right pats the seat next to her, inviting his father's company.
            </p>
            <p class="line">
                She has short blonde hair, a dark dress, and shining lips. The father seats himself next to her and the son relunctantly
                joins the woman on the left. She's also blonde, almost 30 or just past it, with a blue dress with matching
                irises hidden behind thick rimmed glasses.
            </p>
            <p class="line">
                A melancholic and petite bartender appears silently with a pad to take their orders. The father orders a local liquor for
                his son and himself although he doesn't often drink.
            </p>
            <p class="line">
                --Oh? Aren't you going to offer me a drink? the woman next to him asks in an almost offended tone.
            </p>
            <p class="line">
                --Sure, the father says slowly, as if appeasing a child. She orders a champage for herself.
            </p>
            <p class="line">
                --And one for my friend? she adds.
            </p>
            <p class="line">
                The woman assigned to the son initiates small talk by asking the same questions the man did on the street. He reponds to
                the woman in unnaturally short sentences peppered with strange intonation as one does when they're not listening.
                His attention is fixated instead on his father's conversation. He's careful not to hear anuthing that would
                be embarassing to either party while preparing himself to interject when she inevitably escaltes the scam.
            </p>
            <p class="line">
                The woman in the blue dress asks the son about his job, which he lies about. He doesn't return the question to avoid embarassing
                her, which has the opposite effect. She asks about his relationship to the man next to him, which prompts
                her to ask about his mother. She seems genuinely sorry when he informs her that she had recently passed away.
                The tone seems to have shifted as she becomes aware he is not interested in her sexual services, though it
                doesn't seem to upset her. She seems kind and intelligent and upon noticing that the son becomes momentarily
                saddened. A few moments pass before he overhears the other prostitute ask his father for another drink. He
                interrupts with an excuse to leave, scarecely concealing his discomfort.
            </p>
            <p class="line">
                --Want to go? his father begins slowly --Alright, well it was good talking to you. The prostitute pouts. The bartender reappears
                and presents the check to the father.
            </p>
            <p class="line">
                --This can't be right, he says in naïve disbelief, asserting as if there had been some genuine error.
            </p>
            <p class="line">
                The bartender avoids all eye contact and drags her finger along the check connecting the drink to the price. The son, seeing
                his father extend a fifty dollar bill, grasps his father's hand and says --Look, we know exactly what's going
                on here. We'll give you fifteen euro for the drinks. The father tries to diffuse the situation.
            </p>
            <p class="line">
                --The guy who brought us in here said he'll pay for our drinks And he said he'd give me his friend's phone number. No one
                responses and the son cranes his head around the rightside pillar to find the man staring down into the blue
                light of a cheap cell phone. --I'll pay for your drinks buy mine are on him, the father says, leafing out
                twenty five euros and placing them on the table timidly. --Okay? he appeals.One short moment of silence prompts
                him to place another ten euros on the table. --As a tip, he says. --Well, thanks for the conversation he
                says as his son places his arm around his shoulders and leads him out of the bar to prevent further monetary
                extraction.
            </p>
            <p class="line">
                Away from the scent of human trafficking, the son asks his father --What is wrong with you?
            </p>
            <p class="line">
                --What?
            </p>
            <p class="line">
                --Giving them all that money.
            </p>
            <p class="line">
                --It wasn't that much. Eh, it was for the conversation.
            </p>
            <p class="line">
                --What conversation? With two whores who just want more money?
            </p>
            <p class="line">
                --It's not like I didn't know they were Ukrainian whores, that much was obvious.
            </p>
            <p class="line">
                --Then why did we stay?
            </p>
            <p class="line">
                --It'll make a good story.
            </p>
            <p class="line">
                --What story? Getting robbed by scumbags?
            </p>
            <p class="line">
                --I didn't get robbed. It's 25 dollars.
            </p>
            <p class="line">
                --It was 35 euros.
            </p>
            <p class="line">
                --That was a tip.
            </p>
            <p class="line">
                --For what?
            </p>
            <p class="line">
                --So what? was it worth an argument?
            </p>
            <p class="line">
                --Yes, it was.
            </p>
            <p class="line">
                --It'll make a good story.
            </p>
            <p class="line">
                --Story. Just like the taxi driver in Yerevan. He robs you of one hundred and thirteen dollars and you say it'll make a good
                story.
            </p>
            <p class="line">
                --That was different. That guy acted like he was my long lost brother.
            </p>
            <p class="line">
                --It's the same exact thing. Someone taking advantage of you and you letting them.
            </p>
            <p class="line">
                --Well.
            </p>
            <p class="line">
                The son doesn't respond and after walking togerther a while he tells his father he wants to be alone.
            </p>
            <p class="line">
                --Okay, well, just meet me at the hotel in about an hour.
            </p>
            <p class="line">
                --It might be longer than that, he reponds curtly.
            </p>
            <p class="line">
                The father starts towards the hotel and the son instantly regrets causing his lugubrious mood. He at once broods over his
                father's aversion to confrontation and is embarassed by his own treatment of him.
